      "Abstract CRISPR/Cas9 is a powerful genome editing system but uncontrolled Cas9 nuclease expression triggers off-target effects and even in vivo immune responses. Inspired by synthetic biology, here we built a synthetic switch that self-regulates Cas9 expression not only in the transcription step by guide RNA-aided self-cleavage of cas9 gene, but also in the translation step by L7Ae:K-turn repression system. We showed that the synthetic switch enabled simultaneous transcriptional and translational repression, hence stringently attenuating the Cas9 expression. The restricted Cas9 expression induced high efficiency on-target indel mutation while minimizing the off-target effects. Furthermore, we unveiled the correlation between Cas9 expression kinetics and on-target/off-target mutagenesis. The synthetic switch conferred detectable Cas9 expression and concomitant high frequency on-target mutagenesis at as early as 6 h, and restricted the Cas9 expression and off-target effects to minimal levels through 72 h.

Throughout the years, clinical trials based on gene therapies have led to the cure of diseases such as X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1), adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA-SCID) and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Despite the success gene therapy has had, there is still the risk of genotoxicity due to the potential oncogenesis introduced by utilising viral vectors. Research has focused on alternative strategies like genome editing without viral vectors as a means to reduce genotoxicity introduced by the viral vectors.

Our approach, inspired by natural language processing (NLP) models such as BERT, adapts an encoder-only architecture specifically for channel prediction tasks.

      "Natural language processing (NLP) based on deep learning provides a positive performance for generative dialogue system, and the transformer model is a new boost in NLP after the advent of word vectors.

That is, questions can perceive context information in both directions, while reply sentences can only output one-way autoregressive. The above system improvements make the one-way generation of dialogue tasks more logical and reasonable, and the performance is better than the traditional dialogue system scheme. In consideration of the long-distance information weakness of absolute position coding, we put forward the improvement of relative position coding in theory, and verify it in subsequent experiments.

Experimental results are developed and presented for the MaFaulDa and CWRU databases. T4PdM was able to achieve an overall accuracy of 99.98% and 98% for both datasets, respectively. In addition, the performance of the proposed model is compared to other previously published works. It has demonstrated the superiority of the model in detecting and classifying faults in rotating industrial machinery. Therefore, the proposed Transformer-based model can improve the performance of machinery fault analysis and diagnostic processes and leverage companies to a new era of the Industry 4.0.

This paper aims to evaluate a complete selfattention mechanism with a Transformer network to capture COVID-19 pattern over CT images.

Although thermal stress is widely recognized as the main driver of coral bleaching, exposure to light also plays a central role. Future projections of the impacts of climate change on coral reefs have to date focused on temperature change and not considered the role of clouds in attenuating the bleaching response of corals. In this study, we develop temperature- and light-based bleaching prediction algorithms using historical sea surface temperature, cloud cover fraction and downwelling shortwave radiation data together with a global-scale observational bleaching dataset observations. The model is applied to CMIP6 output from the GFDL-ESM4 Earth System Model under four different future scenarios to estimate the effect of incorporating cloudiness on future bleaching frequency, with and without thermal adaptation or acclimation by corals. The results show that in the low emission scenario SSP1-2.6 incorporating clouds into the model delays the bleaching frequency conditions by multiple decades in some regions, yet the majority (>70%) of coral reef cells still experience dangerously frequent bleaching conditions by the end of the century. In the moderate scenario SSP2-4.5, however, the increase in thermal stress is sufficient to overwhelm the mitigating effect of clouds by mid-century. Thermal adaptation or acclimation by corals could further shift the bleaching projections by up to 40 years, yet coral reefs would still experience dangerously frequent bleaching conditions by the end of century in SPP2-4.5.

However, divergent choices in model outputs and scenarios limited the analysis to a fraction of available studies. We found substantial discrepancies in the projected impacts, indicating that the subset of articles serving as a basis for climate change syntheses may project more severe consequences than other studies and methodologies. Drawing on insights from other fields, we propose methods to incorporate uncertainty into deterministic modeling approaches and propose a multi-model ensemble approach to generating probabilistic projections for coral reef futures. Global warming targets are considered inadequate to protect coral reefs, but this prognosis is based on models with similar approaches. This systematic review of studies that project coral responses to climate change found that divergent modelling methodologies had discrepancies in coral reef outcomes, and that those used for climate change syntheses may project more severe consequences than other methods."

Furthermore, the accuracy of error correction codes can be increased with the use of higher accuracy quantum qubits and quantum gates.",
      "Quantum technologies have shown immeasurable potential to effectively solve several information processing tasks such as prime number factorization, unstructured database search or complex macromolecule simulation. As a result of such capability to solve certain problems that are not classically tractable, quantum machines have the potential revolutionize the modern world via applications such as drug design, process optimization, unbreakable communications or machine learning. However, quantum information is prone to suffer from errors caused by the so-called decoherence, which describes the loss in coherence of quantum states associated to their interactions with the surrounding environment. This decoherence phenomenon is present in every quantum information task, be it transmission, processing or even storage of quantum information. Consequently, the protection of quantum information via quantum error correction codes (QECC) is of paramount importance to construct fully operational quantum computers. Understanding environmental decoherence processes and the way they are modeled is fundamental in order to construct effective error correction methods capable of protecting quantum information. In this thesis, the nature of decoherence is studied and mathematically modelled; and QECCs are designed and optimized so that they exhibit better error correction capabilities."

    "actual_output": "Iontophoresis (IP) and lipid\u2011nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulation represent two complementary approaches that address distinct challenges of minimal mRNA vaccine delivery.  \n\n1. **Enhancement of intracellular uptake and immune activation by iontophoresis** \u2013 The study on a minimal mRNA vaccine encoding the melanoma\u2011associated gp100 peptide demonstrated that IP can drive the transdermal and intracellular transport of the otherwise poorly permeable mRNA molecule, which is hindered by its high molecular weight and negative charge\u202f[2]. IP\u2011mediated delivery resulted in robust activation of skin\u2011resident immune cells, marked elevation of interferon\u2011\u03b3 (IFN\u2011\u03b3) expression, and pronounced infiltration of cytotoxic CD8\u207a T cells within tumor tissue, culminating in potent tumor inhibition in a murine melanoma model\u202f[2]. These findings illustrate that IP can overcome intrinsic delivery barriers of naked mRNA and directly stimulate a cellular immune response.\n\n2. **Stabilization of mRNA and facilitation of antigen\u2011presenting cell uptake by LNPs** \u2013 Lipid nanoparticles protect naked mRNA from extracellular ribonucleases and promote efficient trafficking to antigen\u2011presenting cells\u202f[3]. Systematic variation of LNP size revealed that particles in the 80\u2013100\u202fnm range provide optimal physicochemical stability, exhibiting minimal precipitation and aggregation, and retain their protective function during storage at both 4\u202f\u00b0C and \u201320\u202f\u00b0C, with the latter offering superior long\u2011term stability\u202f[3]. Because smaller LNPs disperse more effectively in solution, they are more readily taken up by dendritic cells, thereby enhancing antigen presentation and the ensuing adaptive immune response\u202f[3].\n\n3. **Implications for rapid vaccine development and deployment** \u2013 The review of mRNA vaccine technology emphasizes that nucleic\u2011acid vaccines bypass the need for large\u2011scale virus culture and attenuation, allowing a swift transition from genome sequencing to vaccine production\u202f[1]. The combination of rapid design (enabled by the nucleic\u2011acid platform) with delivery technologies that improve stability (LNP size optimization) and cellular uptake (IP) can accelerate the generation of safe and effective countermeasures against novel or engineered pathogens\u202f[1,2,3]. Moreover, the review notes that mRNA vaccines do not integrate into host DNA, reinforcing their safety profile for military and civilian use\u202f[1].\n\n**In summary**, iontophoresis directly enhances the transdermal delivery and immunogenic potency of minimal mRNA vaccines, while appropriately sized lipid nanoparticles safeguard mRNA integrity and promote efficient uptake by antigen\u2011presenting cells. Together, these delivery innovations complement the inherent speed of mRNA vaccine design, supporting the rapid development and field deployment of high\u2011efficacy biological defenses against emerging threats\u202f[1\u20113].",

      "INTRODUCTION\nVaccine technology has improved substantially since the first smallpox vaccine, developed more than 200\u00a0years ago. As technology improves, vaccines can be produced more safely and reliably for many different pathogens. A recent breakthrough saw the first full deployment of mRNA vaccines to fight a pandemic. Despite the technological and logistical feat of developing a viable vaccine in an abbreviated time frame, there have been many questions about this new approach to vaccine development. The current review will provide descriptions about different types of vaccines as well as answers to some common questions about mRNA vaccines. The purpose is to provide military medical professionals with the information needed to better convey the importance and function of these new vaccines to service members.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThere were no explicit inclusion or exclusion criteria for articles describing mRNA vaccine technology. References included here were intended to illustrate important principles or empirical evidence in demonstrating the safety, efficacy, and function of mRNA vaccines.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe review describes three different types of vaccines: whole-pathogen, subunit, and nucleic acid. Each vaccine type has different implications for the development and production of a vaccine line. For example, whole-pathogen and subunit vaccines often require growing significant amounts of the vaccine sample in laboratory before the material can be incorporated into the vaccine. Nucleic acid vaccines instead provide cells the opportunity to produce key proteins without needing to reproduce the virus and attenuate it in a laboratory setting. This approach has a notable advantage of speed in moving from genome sequencing to vaccine production, but it also creates some potential confusion. The discussion covers three questions with regard to this confusion. First, was the vaccine developed too quickly? Speed here is a byproduct of the new technology and unprecedented government interdepartmental cooperation. No steps were skipped in development or production. Second, does the vaccine modify DNA? No, the mRNA vaccines never enter the cell nucleus and therefore cannot modify DNA. The discussion clarifies how mRNA enters cells and produces the key proteins required to stimulate an immune system response. Third, how long will immunity last? Because mRNA vaccines are new, long-term immunity cannot be projected without significant further study. Still, the discussion does cover issues in determining vaccine efficacy in clinical laboratory trials versus field effectiveness in the real world.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE USES\nThese mRNA vaccines are the newest and most sophisticated defensive tool military medicine has against emerging biological threats. Evolving dangers, such as synthetic biology and engineered pathogens, further enhance the importance of having defensive countermeasures that can be rapidly deployed in response. Current evidence suggests high safety and effectiveness for a biological countermeasure, decades in the making, and military medical personnel should feel confident using and recommending this technology to ensure force health protection.",
      "mRNA vaccines have attracted considerable attention as a result of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic; however, challenges remain regarding use of mRNA vaccines, including insufficient delivery owing to the high molecular weights and high negative charges associated with mRNA. These characteristics of mRNA vaccines impair intracellular uptake and subsequent protein translation. In the current study, we prepared a minimal mRNA vaccine encoding a tumor associated antigen human gp10025-33 peptide (KVPRNQDWL), as a potential treatment for melanoma. Minimal mRNA vaccines have recently shown promise at improving the translational process, and can be prepared via a simple production method. Moreover, we previously reported the successful use of iontophoresis (IP) technology in the delivery of hydrophilic macromolecules into skin layers, as well as intracellular delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA). We hypothesized that combining IP technology with a newly synthesized minimal mRNA vaccine can improve both transdermal and intracellular delivery of mRNA. Following IP-induced delivery of a mRNA vaccine, an immune response is elicited resulting in activation of skin resident immune cells. As expected, combining both technologies led to potent stimulation of the immune system, which was observed via potent tumor inhibition in mice bearing melanoma. Additionally, there was an elevation in mRNA expression levels of various cytokines, mainly interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, as well as infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in the tumor tissue, which are responsible for tumor clearance. This is the first report demonstrating the application of IP for delivery of a minimal mRNA vaccine as a potential melanoma therapeutic.",
      "ABSTRACT Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) technology has been rapidly applied for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine. However, naked mRNA itself is inherently unstable. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) protect mRNAs from extracellular ribonucleases and facilitate mRNA trafficking. For mRNA vaccines, antigen-presenting cells utilize LNPs through uptake to elicit antigen-specific immunity. There are reports on the impact of various physical characteristics of LNPs, particularly those with sizes less than 200\u2009nm, especially 50 to 150\u2009nm, on the overall stability and protective efficacy of mRNA vaccines. To address this, a single change in the size of LNPs using the same mRNA stock solution was assessed for the physicochemical characterization of the resulting mRNA-LNPs vaccine, along with the evaluation of their protective efficacy. Particles of smaller sizes generally disperse more effectively in solutions, with minimized occurrence of particle precipitation and aggregation. Here, we demonstrate that the vaccine containing 80\u2013100\u2009nm mRNA-LNPs showed the best stability and protection at 4\u00b0C and \u221220\u00b0C. Furthermore, we can conclude that freezing the vaccine at \u221220\u00b0C is more appropriate for maintaining stability over the long term. This effort is poised to provide a scientific basis for improving the quality of ongoing mRNA vaccine endeavors and providing information on the development of novel products."
